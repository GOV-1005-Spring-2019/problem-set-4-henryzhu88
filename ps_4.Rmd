There were `r nrow(dem)` respondents who supported the Democratic candidate.

There were `r (nrow(rep)-nrow(und))` more respondents who favored the Republican candidate than who were Undecided.

There are two gender variables (gender and gender_combined). There are `r nrow(gendiff)` individuals for whom these variables have different values.
