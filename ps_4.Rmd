#Through janitor and readr, I was able to organize csv data into a readable format and begin to parse through data
nc_poll<- read_csv("ps_4_elections-poll-nc09-3.csv")%>%clean_names()
#ML1-Since each row was one respondent, filtering to only the rows that had a Dem response allowed me them to count the number of remaining rows to see how many people supported Democratic candidate through nrow(), showed below in inline code
dem<- nc_poll%>%
  filter(response=="Dem")
#followed a similar procedure for ML2- after filtering for Rep and Und, I took the difference of the nrow()s to count how many more responses were Republican compared to Undecided
rep<- nc_poll%>%
  filter(response=="Rep")
und<- nc_poll%>%
  filter(response=="Und")
#For ML3, I used the != function to determine how many rows existed in which the two gender variables did not match and then counted the rows through nrow() in inline code
gendiff<-nc_poll%>% filter(gender!= gender_combined)
#In ML4, a similar process of != was use to determine how many people who were listed as White in race_eth was not in file_race_black. Filtering for "White" first allowed for only those rows to be shown in the race_eth column
whitediff <-nc_poll%>%select(race_eth, file_race_black)%>%filter(race_eth=="White",race_eth!=file_race_black)
#In ML5, I made two new variables, reptime and demtime that had just one value, the earliest response time. This was accomplished through filtering for each party and then using the head(n=1) function.
reptime<-nc_poll%>%select(response,timestamp)%>%filter(response=="Rep")%>%head(n=1)
demtime<-nc_poll%>%select(response,timestamp)%>%filter(response=="Dem")%>%head(n=1)
#After the two earliest times were found, I then joined the two variables through bind_cols and found the interval separating the two different timestamps, calling it diffpartytime. Through using the %/% minutes(1) function, I was able to convert their standard ymd to a readable minutes form.
bind_cols(reptime,demtime)%>%
  mutate(diffpartytime= interval(timestamp1,timestamp))%>%select(diffpartytime)%>% 
  mutate(diffpartytime_m = diffpartytime %/% minutes(1))
```
There were `r nrow(dem)` respondents who supported the Democratic candidate.

There were `r (nrow(rep)-nrow(und))` more respondents who favored the Republican candidate than who were Undecided.

There are two gender variables (gender and gender_combined). There are `r nrow(gendiff)` individuals for whom these variables have different values.

There are `r nrow(whitediff)` respondents listed as “White” under race_eth who are not listed as “White” under file_race_black.

The first response of Dem came `r bind_cols(reptime,demtime)%>%
  mutate(diffpartytime= interval(timestamp1,timestamp))%>%
  mutate(diffpartytime_m = diffpartytime %/% minutes(1))%>%select(diffpartytime_m)` minutes (rounded to the nearest minute) before the first response of Rep.

#Question 4

Although faceting would work here for each age category, I thought the best representation would be include all the data on one graph and to color-code cell phone vs. landline. A bar chart worked the best, and I decided to create a numerical measure through finding the percentage of cell phone/landline users to total respondents for each age category.
